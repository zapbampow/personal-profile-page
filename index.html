            <p>I'm also a coder and obsessive learner. When I decide to learn something I dive in head first, which is what happened with web development.</p> 
            
            <p>While I consider myself a full-stack developer, I find front end work more enjoyable, with a growing enjoyment working with React and Gatsby. I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, MongoDB, Node, Express, React, Gatsby, GraphQL. Keep scrolling to see examples of my work or check out <a href="https://www.github.com/zapbampow"></a>my code on Github</a>.</p>

            <p>I love that moment when a problem has been turned into a solution and when the intended message has become clear.</p>

            <p>While I like cool design, I tend to be a minimalist when the design style is up to me. I like to do what is needed in order to keep the focus on the central ideas.</p>

            <p><strong>The Project: </strong> To use GatsbyJS, React, and GraphQL to recreate an existing Wordpress blog.</p>
            <p><strong>The Why: </strong> Self hosted Wordpress sites <em>can</em> be slow. I had heard about how using GatsbyJS can pull it's data from Wordpress or another CMS, but then serve a static site that is much quicker. I wanted to explore the ins and outs of Gatsby. </p>
            <p><strong>Challenges: </strong> The biggest challenge I ran into was working with images in Gatsby. There are extensions for working with images and automatically serving appropriately sized images. However, when I attempted to install them, it failed to build. After lots of trial and error I've concluded that there is something incompatiple with these extensions and a windows development environment. This is still an unresolved issue unfortunately.</p>
            <p><strong>Possible Improvements: </strong>In addition to handling images differently, the site still needs responsive styling added to it. Also, there are only a handful of posts on it currently. Given more content, pagination will need to be added. </p>

            <p><strong>The Project: </strong> To create or recreate several church website designs.</p>
            <p><strong>The Why: </strong> My previous career in ministry has given me a particular interest in church websites. In most ways church websites are no different than any others. They just have their particular audiences - members and potential visitors. As a personal project I sometimes work on church site designs. Sometimes I create my own designs. Other times I recreate an existing site I find interesting.</p>
            <p>Each of these are built from scratch and focus on using Flexbox and/or CSS Grid for their layouts. Some of them also exhibit my ability to take a design and recreate it.</p>

            <p><strong>The Project: </strong>Create a blog application from scratch. It uses Semantic UI as the frontend framework and Node, Express, and MongoDB for the backend. Using RESTful routing patterns, I've built a simple blog application that includes commenting, built in post creation, post tags and categories, flash messaging, and user authentication and authorization. </p>
            <p><strong>Challenges: </strong> Because this was my first application to build with Node, Mongo, and Express, there were issues related to my growing familiarity with them. So I learned a ton about how they work together. Playing around with the growing project showed many possible errors that a user could run into. So I built in flash messages to let the user understand the errors they might encounter, like a post not being there.</p>
            <p><strong>Possible Improvements: </strong>There are a number of improvements I plan on adding.  I want to add TinyMCE to the textarea for writing articles in order to make formatting things easier. I also plan to add uploading functionality so that the site can more easily host the images for the articles. I want to build in functionality so that when people comment, it automatically emails the author of the post. Speaking of commenting, the whole commenting system could be more robust. </p>

            <p><strong>Challenges: </strong> </p>
            <p><strong>Possible Improvements: </strong>The visual design and styling can certainly be improved. However, the biggest improvement that could be added would be to have a backend that saves the progress of each user. </p>

            <p><strong>Challenges: </strong> The main challenges I ran into with Simon were related to concurrency - when the computer ran through the sequence it turned on all the lights and sounds at once, instead of in order. I solved the timing issues with setTimout.</p>
            <p><strong>Possible Improvements: </strong>The timing issues could be refactored using better patterns. Additionally, the visuals can be polished a bit. The game could also be improved by adding code to speed up the computer's running of the sequence as it gets longer.</p>

            <p><strong>Possible Improvements: </strong>First, while the AI is unbeatable, currently it doesn't always win when it has the opportunity. I need to improve the AI to make sure that it always wins if possible.</p>
            <p>Second, although it is probably overkill for tic tac toe, the game would be improved and the AI would play a more varied style if I implemented the Minimax algorithm instead of my homegrown logic, which hard codes certain moves in certain situations. Minimax would make it a more "flexible" game.</p>
            <p>Finally, the visual design isn't going to win any awards and would be improved with some work on polishing it up.</p>

            <p><strong>Tools used: </strong> HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges: </strong> I created this as part of freeCodeCamp, so there are plenty of these tools out there. However, as I looked for an eclipse animation to work off of, I couldn't find any that I liked. I used this as an opportunity to dive
              into CSS animation and create something that I haven't seen anywhere else.</p>
            <p><strong>Possible Improvements: </strong>There are a few of usability issues to change. First, it would save if the user could simply type in the amounts for the 2 countdown clocks. Additionally, being able to click "Enter" or the spacebar
              to start and stop the clock would add a little usability. Finally, I also want to continue improving the animation and graphic design of this tool. On screens smaller than 520px wide the elements for the CSS animation don't line up correctly.
              This needs to be fixed.</p>

            <p><strong>Challenges: </strong> the biggest challenge was figuring out the logic to make all the functionality work - how to store and clear all the variables, how to make all the button clicks do what is needed.</p>
            <p><strong>Possible Improvements: </strong>There are some usability issues that I'd like to address. First, it could use 2 clearing buttons, C and AC. The current Clear button acts as the AC button. It clears everything. To be more like a standard calculator it could use a C button to clear the last input.</p>
            <p>Second, when a user enters "1+1+1+1," it gives the correct answer. But it doesn't show an updated tally as they go through. I would like to add that functionality.</p>
            <p>Finally, it would be nice if you could see the full string of inputs from a multistep problem. So that would mainly include updating the UI.</p>
